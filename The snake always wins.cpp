// <! -- The C++ game -->
// I got interested in making games now!! Playing is still a casula thing but lets build one. 
// So the game is this, an invincible snake.
// So we will be playing snale and ladder however we dont know how to design UI. So we will play an invisible game such that the design always favor the snake and the player fools around. 
// The monopoly is replicating an existing reality. thats it for now
